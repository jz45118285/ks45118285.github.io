<tr valign="top"><td width="5%">SS08</td><td width="10%">Important</td><td width="15%">Cross-domain requests</td><td width="70%">Cross-domain requests are unrestricted. To reduce the possibility of an unknown application sending malicious commands to your web services, it is recommended to restrict the use of your services to applications hosted only in domains that you trust. <a href="http://sdmsdev1w001.ordsvy.gov.uk:6080/arcgis/help/en/0154/015400000523000000.htm" target="_blank">More information</a></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width="5%">SS07</td><td width="10%">Important</td><td width="15%">Rest services directory</td><td width="70%">The Rest services directory is accessible through a web browser. Unless being actively used to search for and find services by users, this should be disabled to reduce the chance that your services can be browsed, found in a web search, or queried through HTML forms. This also provides further protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. <a href="http://sdmsdev1w001.ordsvy.gov.uk:6080/arcgis/help/en/0154/0154000005vv000000.htm" target="_blank">More information</a></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width="5%">SS11</td><td width="10%">Recommended</td><td width="15%">PSA account status</td><td width="70%">The primary site administrator account is enabled. It is recommended that you disable this account to ensure that there is not another way to administer ArcGIS Server other than the group or role that has been specified in your identity store. <a href="http://sdmsdev1w001.ordsvy.gov.uk:6080/arcgis/help/en/0154/0154000005w1000000.htm" target="_blank">More information</a></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width="5%">SS14</td><td width="10%">Recommended</td><td width="15%">Server SSL certificate</td><td width="70%">To help reduce web browser warnings or other unexpected behavior from clients communicating with ArcGIS Server, it is recommended to import and use a CA-signed SSL certificate bound to port 6443. <a href="http://sdmsdev1w001.ordsvy.gov.uk:6080/arcgis/help/en/0154/0154000005w2000000.htm" target="_blank">More information</a></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width="5%">SS10</td><td width="10%">Recommended</td><td width="15%">Web adaptor registration</td><td width="70%">One or more web adaptors are registered over HTTP. To allow Server Manager to successfully redirect to HTTPS, all web adaptors should be registered over HTTPS. This requires unregistering the current web adaptor and registering it again by accessing the web adaptor url over HTTPS. <a href="http://sdmsdev1w001.ordsvy.gov.uk:6080/arcgis/help/en/0154/0154000006z3000000.htm" target="_blank">More information</a></td></tr>
